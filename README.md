# sketch-patterns
A library of tileable patterns for Sketch, and the file that created them.

![Hey, it's some patterns](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skumando/sketch-patterns/master/images/example.png)

# About
This repo contains simple tileable background patterns. Diagnol lines, grids, circles, crosshatching, squares, and dots. The majority of these patterns can be recreated in pure CSS.

# sketch-pattern.sketch
The Sketch file contains Pages sorted by pattern type and weight, with Artboards for the individual patterns. Once downloaded you have full control to manipulate and export them to your heart's content.

# /images
The images directory contains an export of all of the patterns in a ready to use format. Import them into sketch and use them in your designs, or load them directly into your project and use them as css background images.
