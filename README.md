# sketch-patterns
A library of tileable patterns for Sketch, and the file that created them.

![Hey, it's some patterns](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skumando/sketch-patterns/master/images/example.png)

This repos is made up of simple and common use tileable background patterns. Diagnol lines of varying weight and spacing, grids, circles, crosshatching, and dots. 

The file sketch-pattern.sketch contains Pages sorted by pattern type and weight, with Artboards for the individual patterns. The images directory contains an export of all of the patterns in a ready to use format. Import them into sketch and use them in your designs, or load them directly into your project and use them as css background images.
